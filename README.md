# Outcome Based Education System 
An outcome based education system helps in improving education of a student by basing the grades on different objectives (outcomes) of various programs and courses. Each program has it's PLOs (Program Learning Objectives) and CLOs (Course Learning Objectives). These are a set of objectives that define what the student should have achieved by the end of a given program/course.

  The courses in each program have some CLOs defined at the time of creation. Whenever the student is given an activity, the different parts of the activity are mapped onto the CLO they fulfill. These CLOs are mapped to the PLOs that they accomplish. This mapping ends up with grades being assigned to PLOs, which can then help understand the strong and weak points of a student clearly.
